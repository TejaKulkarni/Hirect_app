                    You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information about you that we have collected. Upon receiving a 
                    verified request to delete Personal Information, we will do so unless otherwise required or authorized by law. You may 
                    submit a request to delete Personal Information via by emailing us at support@hirect.us or by using the form provided 
                    below under "The Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Personal Data". If you are under 18 years of age, California Business 
                    and Professions Code section 22581 allows California residents under the age of 18 who are registered users of online sites, 
                    services or applications to request and obtain removal of content or information they have publicly posted. To request removal
                    of such data, and if you are a California resident, you can contact us using the contact information provided below, and 
                    include the email address associated with your account. Please be aware that your request does not guarantee complete or 
                    comprehensive removal of content or information posted online and that the law may not permit or require removal in certain 
                    circumstances.<br/>
                    Authorized Agents<br/>
                    You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. You must provide an authorized agent written permission to submit a request on your behalf, and we may require that you verify your identity directly with us. Alternatively, an authorized agent that has been provided power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000-4465 may submit a request on your behalf.<br/>
                    Methods for Submitting Consumer Requests and Our Response to Requests<br/>
                    You may submit a request for access and requests to delete Personal Information about you by emailing us at support@hirect.us. 
                    Upon receipt of a request, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. Any additional information 
                    you provide will be used only to verify your identity and not for any other purpose. We will acknowledge the receipt of 
                    your request within 10 days of receipt. Subject to our ability to verify your identity, we will respond to your request 
                    within 45 days of receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period 
                    in writing. In order to protect your privacy and the security of Personal Information about you, we verify your request and, 
                    if requested, delete the applicable Personal Information within sixty (60) business days following verification.<br/>
                    Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. 
                    The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. We do not 
                    charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly 
                    unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with 
                    a cost estimate before completing your request.<br/>
                    The Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Personal Data<br/>
                    We may be deemed to "sell" your data as the term is defined under CCPA because:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We display your public resume to employers and recruiters.</li>
                        <li>We recommend your public resume to employers and recruiters.</li>
                        <li>We allow third-party cookies to help employers measure job listing performance and to optimize our online advertising.</li>
                        <li>We share data with our affiliates as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    A request to not "sell" or "transfer" your information to a prospective employer prohibits us from providing our services 
                    to you. In order to opt out, you can request that we delete your account and personal data. In order to opt-out of the 
                    "sale" of your information, you can:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Request to have your data deleted through this request form.</li>
                        <li>Email us at support@hirect.us.</li>
                    </ul>
                    By submitting this request, you are declaring that you are a California resident taking advantage of your rights under CCPA. 
                    Once your data is deleted, Hirect will be unable to transfer it. <br/>
                    The Right to Non-Discrimination<br/>
                    You have the right not to be discriminated against for the exercise of your California privacy rights described above. 
                    Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Deny you goods or services;</li>
                        <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;</li>
                        <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or</li>
                        <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
